OpenWRT
=======

OpenWRT_ is a popular open, minimized Linux distribution for embedded
systems. One of the boards available now running OpenWRT_ is the WRTnode_
which includes a WiFi controller and seems especially well-suited for
IoT applications.

Although OpenWRT_ is a heavily minimized it has its own package management
system with dependancy tracking and with many interesting packages
including a MQTT broker named Mosquitto and a minimal Python interpreter
(version 2.7).

This makes it easy to control the input/output pins on a board like this
with a high-level language like Python and libraries like Pingo_ for it.
And it also makes it possible to run the relayr Python-SDK on the board
itself!

Before installing the Python-SDK on OpenWRT a few additional steps are
necessary to add a few features missing in the Python interpreter
installed by default.

Upgrade Python
--------------

The relayr Python-SDK is mostly a client for the RESTful HTTP relayr
API, implemented using the ``requests`` package which itself builds on
``urllib3``. The minimal default Python interepreter on OpenWRT does
not support these, so it must be upgraded to do that.

Minimizing Python Code
----------------------

Code minimization is usually performed on Javacript libraries to reduce
download times in webbrowsers. On embedded devices the precious resource
is memory (on a WRTnode_ it's 16 MB of flash user memory). Therefore, it
can sometimes be helpful to reduce the size of any larger Python software
to be installed, too, either by a third party or by yourself.

The recommended tool for minimizing Python code is pyminifier_ which in
its simple forms will strip-off docstrings and comments and minimize the
indentation of Python source files. You can use it on the relayr
Python-SDK for example as follows before installing it on OpenWRT_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyminifier
    wget https://github.com/relayr/python-sdk/archive/0.2.4.tar.gz
    tar xfz 0.2.4.tar.gz
    cd 0.2.4
    pyminifier *.py
